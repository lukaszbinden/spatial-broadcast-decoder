# spatial-broadcast-decoder
Spatial Broadcast Decoder Implementation using Tensorflow. This implements only the decoder as proposed in the paper.

See the original paper for specifications:
Spatial Broadcast Decoder: A Simple Architecture for Learning Disentangled Representations in VAEs
https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07017

Note that the convolutional part of the spatial broadcast decoder has a different implementation than in the paper. Just go ahead and adjust the channel numbers for each layer.
